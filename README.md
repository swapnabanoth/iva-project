# 🐾 Pet Patrol: Detecting Cats and Dogs using YOLOv5

This project uses **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)** for real-time object detection of **cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶** in images and videos.  
The implementation is done in **Google Colab** with PyTorch and OpenCV, allowing you to upload images/videos and detect pets with bounding boxes.

---

## 📌 Features
- Detect **cats** and **dogs** from images.
- Detect pets in **videos** (frame-by-frame).
- Bounding boxes with confidence scores.
- Works in **real-time inference** (limited by hardware).
- Implemented in **Google Colab** (no setup needed locally).
